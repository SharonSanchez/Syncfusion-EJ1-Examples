    brackets (like &lt;html&gt;),within the web page content. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like and ,although
    some tags, known as empty elements, are unpaired, for example
    &lt;img&gt;. The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into
    visible or audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses
    the tags to interpret the content of the page.
